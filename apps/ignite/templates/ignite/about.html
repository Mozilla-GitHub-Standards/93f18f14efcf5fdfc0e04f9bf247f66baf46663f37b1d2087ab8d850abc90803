<h2>What Kind of Apps Can I Build?</h2>
<p class="intro">You can make something small and novel, or big and revolutionary. The challenge is open for apps that leverage gigabit smart networks for innovation in:</p>
<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box emer">
<h3>Emergency Preparedness and Public Safety</h3>
<p>Emergency preparedness and public safety are being revolutionized at nearly every stage by advanced information and communication technologies. Widespread sensor networks and sophisticated real-time analysis allow early detection of events ranging from severe weather and natural disasters to national security threats. Advanced simulations and predictive modeling allow sophisticated preparation as well as training for events before they occur by emergency first responders to every member of the public. Two-way flows of real-time data from diverse sources (e.g. cell phones, GPS, sensors) combined with computational models and communication technologies can provide detailed situational awareness and coordination of actions during an emergency.</p>
<a href="{{ url('create_entry') }}" class="cta">Share an idea</a>
</div>
<div class="col box edu">
<h3>Education and Workforce Technologies</h3>
<p>Telepresence can take students across the world to experience archeological dig sites, distant classrooms, or foreign cultures. Medical students, surgical residents or world experts can keep their skills sharp with advanced virtual surgeries, allowing them to practice on patient-specific, real image based models with accurate tissue movement and haptic feedback, simulating the nuances of real life surgery. Workers can expand skillsets through professional development courses and workforce training in areas such as advanced manufacturing or product development using modeling and simulation, accessing computing resources and data analysis tools that real workers use on the job for the actual jobs they hope to obtain.</p>

<div class="col box health">
<h3>Health Information Technologies</h3>
<p>Sliceable, programmable networks could provide high levels of privacy and security for health data. In-home sensor systems and real-time analysis of data might lead to early detection of conditions such as cognitive impairment or increased likelihood of falling to allow early intervention and even preemption of adverse health outcomes. Telemedicine will allow easy, efficient communication between patients and their caregivers and increased access to high quality health information from diverse sources in cheaper and more efficient ways. Rapid exchange of large amounts of medical data with high-resolution collaborative tools will enable the efficient exchange of ideas and knowledge between medical experts on the care team. Platforms for interoperable data exchange will allow “big data” in health from diverse sources to be pulled together and analyzed along with current knowledge and best practices to create a learning health system that provides customized, real-time decision support for all members of the care team when and where it is needed.</p>

<div class="col box energy">
<h3>Clean Energy, including Advanced Vechile Technologies</h3>
<p>Sustainable living, ranging from smart grids with high temporal and spatial
control of energy as well as intelligent homes, buildings, and
transportation systems, even to prevention of unnecessary energy use.
Advanced battery systems and increasing diversity and demands of different
energy creation and storage systems need much smarter systems of control.
The security of our energy systems is also a big issue that some of the GENI
technologies like isolated network slices could dramatically transform.</p>

<h3>Advanced Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Simulation as well as computational design processes and sharing of data,
knowledge, tools, and expertise.  Many of these models and simulations
require powerful supercomputing resources for product development and firms
need access to these resources to be competitive both locally as well as
globally.  Thus, high bandwidth, interactive computing systems are essential
to the future of manufacturing in this country.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Category</h3>
<p>If your app doesn’t fall squarely in one category, pick the one that most accurately describes the public benefit you want to create. So, for example, no games for games' sake—but an educational or workforce development game would be welcome.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section class="tech">
<h2>What technologies should I use?</h2>
<div class="content_columns columns">
<div class="col main box">
<p class="intro">On the network side, plan to build your app on <a href="http://www.geni.net/">GENI</a>—a fast, programmable, sliceable network sandbox. With GENI, you have a lot of flexibility, and opportunities to test your gigabit app in the lab or <a href="resources.html#field">in the field</a>. Learn more about <a href="resource.html">getting started with GENI here</a>.

You can build an app the old fashioned way, using TCP/IP and a client-server model. Or you can experiment with custom protocols, OpenFlow routing, and lots of other future networking technologies. It’s up to you.

On the client side, you can use any technologies you want, but we ask that you favor open source and open standards. And no proprietary runtimes—i.e., no Flash or iOS apps.</p>

<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box">
<h3>Browser Technologies</h3>
<p>Where possible, your apps should run in a browser or web runtime. We highly encourage you to explore edge web technologies, like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5">HTML5</a>, <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebGL">WebGL</a>, <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webcl/">WebCL</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebSockets">Websockets</a>, and more. 
<p>
</div>
<div class="col box">
<h3>Web as Platform</h3>
<p>We think that the deeply connected future needs a common, freely implementable, consensus-based development platform. And even as the role of the browser changes—and the distinction between local and remote code begins to blur—we think the web will be the best and most universal platform to build apps from the future.</p>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col box bonus">
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Is this just about network speed?</h3>
<p>Sure, gigabit networks are cool. But they’re not the whole story—we’re thinking much bigger.

We’re asking developers to suspend their assumptions about today’s internet. Imagine there are no limits on how fast information can travel; that processor speed is never a bottleneck; and that your network adapts to your app, instead of the other way around.

Imagine that you’re able to place both processing and data transport wherever you want on the network. You can dynamically provision and program routers along the middle of the network, as if the network itself were a giant LAN. 

We’re more interconnected than ever before, with smartphones, computers, appliances, and other devices. With a 1Gbps smart grid like the one in Chattanooga, you can turn a whole city into a giant supercomputer. 

So, how can we re-wire our communities and make people’s lives better? What kinds of impossible apps are made possible?

By partnering with GENI, we’re able to build and test some of these far out ideas. In this challenge, we’ll spend some time in the future—and explore how to make the Internet an even more powerful public resource.</p>

<section class="geni">
<p class="intro">
GENI, the General Environment for Network Innovation, is a sandbox where you can play with future networking concepts.

Say you have an idea about how to make people happier, or healthier, or more well informed—but that idea is too big for today's internet.

Transfer speeds are too slow, latency is too high, or your users’ computers aren’t fast enough. Or, maybe you need the network to work differently. Whatever the reason, the naysayers will tell you that it can't be built.
<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box">
<h3>Living in the Future</h3>
<p>Now imagine that none of these limitations apply. Information can travel as fast as it needs to. "Loading" and "latency" are things thing of the past. And as an app developer, you can program the entire network, from the clients and servers to all the middle boxes in between. GENI, the "Global Environment for Network Innovations," is a sandboxed experimenters' network. It's like a scale model of many future internets. And it's where you'll develop and deploy apps in the Ignite Apps Challenge.</p>
<p>
</div>
<div class="col box">
<h3>Programmable + Sliceable</h3>
<p>If you’re a networking geek, check this out: using GENI, you can take a slice of the network and create your own virtual networks. You can directly access Layer 2 resources, getting more control and flexibility than what’s afforded by the commodity Internet. And there’s computing and storage clusters at many points in the network— “programmable local clouds” — so you can optimize computing, storage, and networking aspects of their apps, simultaneously. 

GENI will help you build and test your app, whether you’re building a small and novel app or a revolution in networking.</p>

<h2>More Questions?</h2>
<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box">
<h3>What is US Ignite?</h3>
<p>US Ignite seeks to develop applications and services for ultra-fast broadband networks. It will foster the creation of novel applications and digital experiences that have the potential to transform areas of national priority such as healthcare, education and job skills training, public safety, energy, and advanced manufacturing. Read more at the <a href="http://us-ignite.org/">US Ignite website.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="col box">
<h3>Who should enter? Do I need to be a US citizen to compete?</h3>
<p>For web developers, university researchers, start-ups and visionaries, this is a great opportunity to build an app from the future—and get your work noticed. It's also a good way to pursue experimentation without investing a lot of time in a complex funding application.

Anyone can compete in the ideas challenge and the development challenge.
However, as this is a federally-funded initiative, each team must designate a fiscal agent who will accept awards on the team's behalf. Only U.S.-incorporated organizations and citizens can accept awards.

Practically, this means that teams can have members from all over the world—but must also have at least one team member, or a host, in the United States.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box">
<h3>Do I need to compete in the brainstorm in order to compete in the development challenge?</h3>
<p>No—anyone can compete in the development challenge. The brainstorm is not a prerequisite. That said, the brainstorm is an excellent way to discover, synthesize, and refine thinking around "apps from the future." And through the brainstorm, you may find like-minded people to join your team and compete in the development challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="col box">
<h3>Why are you running three rounds of development?</h3>
<p>Rather than a winner-takes-all approach, the Mozilla Ignite apps challenge uses an "iterative funding" process. Over three rounds, the challenge jury will meet and award teams for the progress and promise they show. This way, teams with crazy ambitious ideas can compete side-by-side with smaller experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box">
<h3>How much money can I earn?</h3>
<p><strong>ADD MINIMUMS. </strong>The awards recognize your progress and achievements, and are meant to give you a launching pad for your work. (Of course, you could develop an app, take the money, and walk between rounds. But we hope you’re as excited about the future as we are, and want to keep building.)

Another benefit of this approach is that the community will up its game as more and more interesting apps emerge. Teams will develop their apps in public, in real-time. They'll be required to blog regularly and commit their code to public repositories so they can get help, advice, and contributions from the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="col box">
<h3>Do I keep my intellectual property?</h3>
<p>Absolutely.

We hope that some of the apps developed in this challenge will someday grow up and become commercially viable. And we want to encourage entrepreneurial exploration at the edges of the network. If you develop something awesome in this challenge, it's yours to go monetize (or not).

That said, another objective of this challenge is to build an open development community around GENI, the open web, and other open technologies. And we think that open source is one of the most powerful ways to do that. So all competing apps must publish their code under a <strong>suitably open license</strong>. Check the official rules for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="columns equal">
<div class="col box">
<h3>Why is Mozilla doing this?</h3>
<p>Mozilla's mission is to shape future of Internet as public resource—offering choice, transparency, and control to developers and users. By working with researchers, developers, and businesspeople, we can drive innovation that benefits people in their everyday lives—and that keeps the internet open and competitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="col box">
<h3>Are there rules?</h3>
<p>Yep, check out the full legal rules <a href="rules.html">here</a>.</p>

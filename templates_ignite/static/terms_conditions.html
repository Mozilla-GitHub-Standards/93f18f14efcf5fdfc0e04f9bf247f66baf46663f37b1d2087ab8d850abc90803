<h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
                                                                 
<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>Mozilla Foundation (“Mozilla” or “Sponsor”) is a global non-profit organization with a mission to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web.  In cooperation with the United States National Science Foundation (“NSF”), Mozilla presents this IDEAS Challenge (the “Ideas Challenge”) seeking ideas to enhance or improve the public’s understanding of how web apps running on next-generation networks could improve people’s everyday lives, particularly in the areas of:  Health, Transportation, Clean Energy, Learning, Public Safety, and Advanced Manufacturing (the “Priority Areas”).   Ideas accepted in the Challenge will be published to help inspire invention and development to benefit the Web community, including inspiration for projects in the separate DEVELOPMENT Challenge that will be conducted after this Ideas Challenge is completed.</p>

<h2>When to Submit Ideas:</h2>

<p>The Ideas Challenge begins on Tuesday, May 1st 2012 at 12:00:01 am Pacific Time (“PT”), and all submissions must be received by Friday June 22nd, 2012 at 11:59:59 pm PT (“Ideas Challenge Term”).  You are responsible for knowing the time zone and date in your location.  It is recommended not to wait until the last moment to submit an idea.  Proof of submission is not proof of receipt.  Sponsor’s database computer is the official timekeeping device for the Ideas Challenge.</p>

<h2>Who Can Submit Ideas:</h2>

<p>Participation is open to individuals, teams of individuals, companies, academic institutions and non-profit organizations (each a “Participant”).  Any individual Participant (including a member of a team or a representative of a company or other organization) must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in his/her place of residence if it is higher than 18).  The Development Challenge is not open to persons or entities in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Union of Myanmar, the Province of Quebec, or any country subject to embargo by the United States, or any jurisdiction where the Development Challenge would be prohibited or restricted by law.   Ideas Challenge judges and employees of Mozilla, NSF, and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and their immediate families and people living in their households, are not eligible to participate.  Sponsor, at its sole discretion, shall determine eligibility of any individual or entity, and may disqualify any Participant at any time for any reason.</p>

<p>If an idea submission is made on behalf of a group of individuals, a company, or any other type of organization (a “Team”), the person making the submission on behalf of the Team (the “Captain”) must: (a) disclose as part of the initial submission the name of the company or organization, if any, and the names of all individuals participating in the submission and development of the app (“Team Members”); (b) certify that the Captain has the right to act on behalf of the Team (be it an entity or a group of individuals) and all Team Members; (c) agree to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of the Team and all Team Members, and (d) be a legal resident or citizen of the United States or hold a lawfully issued student visa, work permit, or other documentation entitling the Captain to work or receive compensation for work in the United States.  In addition, each Team Member must individually register on the Ideas Challenge Website  and accept these Terms and Conditions during the Ideas Challenge Term.   Failure to do so may result in disqualification of the submitted idea from further consideration in this Ideas Challenge.</p> 

<h2>How to Submit an Idea:</h2>

<p>During the Ideas Challenge Term, register and submit your idea(s) online at www.mozillaignite.org (the “Ideas Challenge Website”). Registration and submissions will be accepted only via the Ideas Challenge Website.    All registrations and submissions must be in English.  You must provide a valid email address, which will be the means to communicate with you.</p>  

<h2>Submission Process:</h2>

<p>All sections of the registration and/or submission forms must be completed to create a valid submission into the Ideas Challenge (“Submission”).   Submissions may be made in draft or final mode.  If you make a Submission in draft mode, you can make changes to it until the end of the Ideas Challenge Term.  Once you make a Submission in final mode,  no further changes can be made.    All Submissions automatically are deemed to be in final mode at the end of the Ideas Challenge Term.</p>

<p><strong>LIMIT:  THREE (3) SUBMISSIONS PER PARTICIPANT.</strong> Subsequent Submissions from the same Participant or email address will be disqualified.  In the event of a dispute over identity, the Submission will be deemed submitted by the authorized account holder of the e-mail account associated with the Submission.  “Authorized account holder” is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, on-line service provider, or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.  In the event two or more Submissions/ideas are substantially similar, only the first one will be considered.</p>
 
<p>No responsibility is assumed for: (i) lost, late, incomplete, invalid, illegible, incorrect, inaccurate or misdirected registrations or Submissions, all of which are void;  (ii) failed, partial or garbled computer transmissions; (iii) any failure, problem, or technical malfunction including, but not limited to any telephone or other network or lines, computer online systems, servers or providers, computer equipment, software, email, web browser on account of technical problems, traffic congestion or the Internet or at any web site, any combination thereof, or otherwise, including without limitation injury or damage to your or to any other person's computer related to or resulting from participating in or uploading materials for the Ideas Challenge; or (iv) for any error, human, technical or otherwise that may occur in the processing of Submissions.  Sponsor, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to disqualify any Submission not in compliance with these Terms and Conditions for any reason.<p>

<h1>The Mozilla Ignite Apps DEVELOPMENT Grant Challenge</h1>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<h3 class="point">Overview:</h3>   

<p>Mozilla Foundation (“Mozilla” or “Sponsor”) is a global non-profit organization with a mission to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web.  In cooperation with the United States National Science Foundation (“NSF”), Mozilla presents this DEVELOPMENT Grant Challenge (the “Development Challenge”) to help foster and support the development of web apps running on next-generation networks that could improve people’s everyday lives, particularly in the areas of:  Healthcare Information Technology, Transportation, Clean Energy, Learning, Public Safety, and Advanced Manufacturing (the “Priority Areas”).  Apps submitted in this Development Challenge may be based on ideas submitted in the separate Ideas Challenge conducted prior to this Development Challenge, but may also be based on other ideas.  There is no limit other than your imagination. </p>

<h3 class="point">Submission Period:</h3>

<p>The Development Challenge begins on Saturday, September 8, 2012 at 12:00:01 am Pacific Time (“PT”), and all proposals for apps to be developed must be received by Friday, September 28, 2012 at 11:59:59 pm US Pacific Timezone (“Development Challenge Term”) to be considered in the first round of the Development Phase.  Submissions to subsequent rounds of the Development Phase are due two weeks before each round begins.  You are responsible for knowing the time zone and date in your location.  It is recommended not to wait until the last moment to submit a proposal.  Proof of submission is not proof of receipt.  Sponsor’s database computer is the official timekeeping device for the Development Challenge.  Late submissions may be considered in Sponsor’s discretion, but only for any aspect(s) of the Development Challenge that are scheduled to begin at least two weeks after the date of the submission.</p>

<h4>Who Can Participate:</h4>

<p>Participation is open to individuals, teams of individuals, companies, academic institutions and non-profit organizations (each a “Participant”).  Any individual Participant (including a member of a team or a representative of a company or other organization) must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in his/her place of residence if it is higher than 18).  The Development Challenge is not open to persons or entities in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, the Province of Quebec, or any country subject to embargo by the United States, or any jurisdiction where the Development Challenge would be prohibited or restricted by law.  Development Challenge judges and employees of Mozilla, NSF, and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and their immediate families and people living in their households, are not eligible to participate.  Sponsor, at its sole discretion, shall determine eligibility of any individual or entity, and may disqualify any Participant at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>If an app proposal is submitted on behalf of a group of individuals, a company, or any other type of organization (a “Team”), the person making the submission on behalf of the Team (the “Captain”) must:  (a) disclose as part of the initial submission the name of the company or organization, if any, and the names of all individuals participating in the submission and development of the app (“Team Members”);  (b) certify that the Captain has the right to act on behalf of the Team (be it an entity or a group of individuals) and all Team Members;  (c) agree to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of the Team and all Team Members, and  (d) be a legal resident or citizen of the United States or hold a lawfully issued student visa, work permit, or other documentation entitling the Captain to work or receive compensation for work in the United States.  In addition, each Team Member must individually register on the Development Challenge Website and accept these Terms and Conditions during the Development Challenge Term.1  Failure to do so may result in disqualification of the submitted app from further consideration for support as part of this Development Challenge.</p>

<h4>Where to Submit a Proposal for an App:</h4>

<p>During the Development Challenge Term, register and submit your app proposal online at www.mozillaignite.org (the “Development Challenge Website”).  Registration and submissions will be accepted only via the Development Challenge Website.  All registrations and submissions must be in English.  The Participant (or Captain in the case of a Team) must provide a valid email address, which will be the means to communicate with the Participant.</p> 
<h4>Submission Process:</h4>

<p>All sections of the registration and/or submission forms must be completed to be a valid submission into the Development Challenge (“Submission”).  Submissions may be made in draft or final mode.  If you make a Submission in draft mode, you can make changes to it until the end of the Development Challenge Term.  Once you make a Submission in final mode, no further changes can be made.  All Submissions automatically are deemed to be in final mode at the end of the Development Challenge Term.  Late submissions may be considered in Sponsor’s discretion, but only for any aspect(s) of the Development Challenge that are scheduled to begin at least two weeks after the date of the submission, and any late Submission is deemed final upon receipt.</p>

<p>LIMIT:  THREE (3) SUBMISSIONS PER PERSON AND PER TEAM.  Subsequent Submissions from the same person, Team or email address will be disqualified.  In the event of a dispute over the identity of any Participant, Captain or Team Member, he/she will be deemed to be the authorized account holder of the e-mail account associated with that person during the registration/submission process on the Development Challenge Website.  “Authorized account holder” is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, on-line service provider, or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.  In the event two or more Submissions/proposals describe substantially similar projects, the judges’ determination of the qualitatively superior proposal will determine which Submission is considered.</p>

<p>No responsibility is assumed for: (i) lost, late, incomplete, invalid, illegible, incorrect, inaccurate or misdirected registrations or Submissions, all of which are void;  (ii) failed, partial or garbled computer transmissions; (iii) any failure, problem, or technical malfunction including, but not limited to any telephone or other network or lines, computer online systems, servers or providers, computer equipment, software, email, web browser on account of technical problems, traffic congestion or the Internet or at any web site, any combination thereof, or otherwise, including without limitation injury or damage to your or to any other person's computer related to or resulting from participating in or uploading materials for the Development Challenge; or (iv) for any error, human, technical or otherwise that may occur in the processing of Submissions.  Sponsor, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to disqualify any Submission not in compliance with these Terms and Conditions for any reason.</p>

<h4>Submission Form Requirements:</h4>

<p>Each Development Challenge Participant must clearly and concisely complete all ten (10) mandatory sections of the Development Challenge submission form, and may also include optional materials per the 11th section (collectively, a “Development Proposal”):</p>

<ol>
<li>What problem are you intending to solve?</li>
<li>How will end users interact with it, and how will they benefit?</li>
<li>What is the technological approach, or development roadmap?</li>
<li>How will your app leverage the 1Gbps, sliceable and deeply programmable network?</li>
<li>Describe yourself and your Team (if applicable), especially the skills that match the challenges of the problem, number of members, roles and how you’ll work together. </li>
<li>How much effort do you expect this work to take? </li>
<li>Will your work be beta-ready by the end of the Development Challenge?</li> 
<li>Which Priority Area(s) does the app address?</li>
<li>Do you have any links you’d like to add to support your Development Proposal (blog, video, etc.)? </li>
<li>Do you need help?  E.g., developers, support from industry experts, mentorship, learning materials, more team members? </li>
<li>Optional supporting materials or resources (images, wireframes, prototypes, URLs, YouTube videos, slide casts, etc.) which may help. Illustrations are optional, but wireframes, prototypes or pictures may help the judges understand your Development Proposal and are invited.</li>
</ol>

<p>Submissions and any subsequent communications or postings associated with the Development Challenge may not contain advertisements, commercial endorsements, or any material that is indecent, obscene, hateful, discriminatory, defamatory, slanderous, libelous, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate as determined by Sponsor in its absolute discretion.  Any inappropriate Submissions or material may be disqualified by Sponsor in its absolute discretion.  Each Development Proposal must also comply with any word limits or other terms or requirements on the Development Challenge Website. </p>

<h4>Development Challenge Judging:</h4>

<p>Evaluation of Submissions will occur during the Development Phase as described below.  The decisions of the judges will be final in all instances.</p>

<p>Development Proposals – Each Development Proposal will be screened initially for three mandatory criteria: (a) Is it in a Priority Area; (b) Does it leverage next generation networking technologies like high speed and software defined networking; and (c) Feasibility -- i.e., considering the idea only (not the Participant or Team), could the idea be delivered in the remaining time available in the Development Challenge.  Those Development Proposals meeting these criteria will be eligible for further review by judges from Mozilla, GENI, NSF, and category-expert reviewers based on the following criteria:<p>

<ol id="judging_scorecard">
<li><strong>Impact:</strong>  To what degree might this app provide significant public benefit by improving people’s lives? To what degree might this app benefit the community of practice around gigabit apps, through open source and standards? - <strong>35%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>   Is the potential public benefit articulated in a clear, compelling way that can excite the general public? - <strong>25%</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong>   To what degree is this app innovative? - <strong>20%</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Next generation networks:</strong>  To what degree does this app leverage next generation networking technologies, like high speed and software defined networking? - <strong>10%</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Priority Area:</strong>  To what degree could this app add value in terms of serving one of the Priority Areas (Healthcare Information Technology, Transportation, Clean Energy, Education and Workforce Technologies, Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, and Advanced Manufacturing)- <strong>5%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong>  How much substantive support has this app gained on its page on the Development Challenge Website? - <strong>5%</strong></li> 
</ol>

<p>Participants with Development Proposals selected to advance to the Development Phase will be notified via email at the Captain/Participant address submitted with the initial Submission.  If your Development Proposal is approved, you will be able to log onto the Challenge Website to see any comments made by the judges about your Development Proposal, and to continue your participation in the Development Phase of the Challenge.</p>
<p>For any Development Proposal accepted for continuation into the Development Phase, the Participant will be expected to report on progress via the Development Challenge Website per the methods set forth below, and the judging in the Development Phase will be based exclusively on these progress reports:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Keep a project blog, occasionally reporting on progress, challenges, and milestones. Participants will be encouraged to explore empirical impact metrics on the blog and think about how the Participant knows its app is providing public benefit.</li>
<li>Develop in the open to the extent you are willing. We recommend keeping: (i) a roadmap or issue tracker (a wiki, Pivotal tracker, etc.); and (ii) a code repository (i.e. GitHub, Sourceforge, Google Code).</li>
<li>Once per judging period, each Participant will have the opportunity to make a 10-15 minute presentation and address questions from the audience during a webinar that Sponsor will facilitate.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="point">Development Phase</h3>

<p>The Development Phase of the Challenge is scheduled to begin on or about Thursday, October 4, 2012 and will consist of three (3) development rounds and subsequent review cycles by a panel of qualified judges.  Progress at each development round will be judged based on whether the Participant, in pursuing its approved Development Proposal, is on track to build something compelling and exciting that clearly exemplifies the opportunities a smart 1 Gbps network presents and provides broad public benefit:  The three development/review rounds are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Proof of Concept (3 weeks), scheduled to begin on or about Thursday, October 4, 2012</li>
<li>Alpha (6 weeks), scheduled to begin on or about Thursday, November 8, 2012</li>
<li>User Ready Beta (14 weeks), scheduled to begin on or about Wednesday, January 16, 2013</li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of each development round, each Participant/Team will have the opportunity to make a 10-minute pitch to share: (i) their progress; (ii) where they are going; and (iii) what they think they need to get to the next step. This will take place in an open webinar format where judges and the general public can make comments and ask questions. These webinars will be archived and available for viewing on the Challenge Website. </p>  

<p>Development grant awards will be made available to projects that are deemed worthy and that are making appropriate progress, all as determined by the judges in their absolute discretion.  Failure to receive a development grant award after any given development round does not preclude eligibility from receiving a grant after a future development round.  However, to continue to be considered for grant support in any later development round in the Development Phase, a Participant must continue to post progress reports to show demonstrable progress toward the challenge goal, and the judges reserve the absolute right, in their discretion, to determine which projects, if any, will be considered for funding in any development round.</p> 

<h4>Development Grants:</h4>

<p>At the end of each development round during the Development Phase of the Challenge, the judges will have ability to award up to a maximum of the amounts of money listed below as grants to support further development of the projects they deem worthy of further support in that round.  The total amount awarded in each development round, the number of Submissions/projects to be supported, and the amount of support given to support any particular project are all within the discretion of the judges on how to promote the continued development of worthwhile projects, subject to the maximum amount available to be awarded by the judges in that round as follows: </p> 

<ol>  
<li>Proof of Concept – USD $85,000 maximum in total grants available.</li>
<li>Alpha – USD $150,000 maximum in total grants available.</li>
<li>User Ready Beta – USD $250,000 maximum in total grants available.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any Participant eligible for a grant award at any given round in the Development Phase is solely responsible for the payment of any taxes that may arise as a result of acceptance of a development grant and for all other expenses or costs of the Participants project not covered by the grant.  Each grant will be in the form of a single payment to the Participant, regardless whether the Participant is an individual, group of individuals, company or other form of organization.  It is up to any Participant/Team receiving a grant to decide how to allocate and use the grant.  In the case of a Team that is a U.S.-based company or organization, the grant will be payable to the company or organization. All other Team awards will be made in the name of the Captain in the United States.  Grant awards cannot be transferred or substituted.</p>
